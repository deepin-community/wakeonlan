Revision history for Perl script wakeonlan.

0.10  2000-04-19  ico@edd.dhs.org

	- Inital release. This works for me...
	- Tested with 3Com 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx


0.20  2000-04-23  ico@edd.dhs.org

	- Major bugfix. When the called system is not known in the ARP-table,
	  no packets are sent. Solved by allowing broadcast-addresses. Use
	  broadcast address as IP and all should work....
	  (Thanks to Egon Kastelijn for making the problem clear to me
	  <egon.kastelijn@xs4all.nl>)


0.30  2000-07-01  ico@edd.dhs.org

	- Some cleaning done by Jose Pedro Oliveira <jpo@di.uminho.pt>: 
    	1. Forced variable declaration with the pragma 'use strict'
		2. Removed the bind call (we don't expect to receive any reply)
		3. Simplified the packet generation


0.31  2000-07-17  ico@edd.dhs.org

	- Changes made by Jose Pedro Oliveira <jpo@di.uminho.pt>
		1. Changed the destination port from the echo (7) to the
		   discard port (9) in order to avoid the reply from an awaken
		   computer with an active echo service.
		2. Removed variables $laddr and $me
		3. Closed the socket
		4. Added the variable $VERSION
		5. Added a link in the README file of the Whitepaper subdirectory
	- Other changes :
		6. Completer checks for valid HW-address (Ico Doornekamp)
